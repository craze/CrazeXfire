ORIGIN

"I want a list of the games I play to put on this webpage." - wildcraze.info

GETTING STARTED

- Have these files available on a webserver somewhere
- Rename xfire.example.conf to xfire.conf and move it outside the web root
- May have to adjust the number of ../ in file reference on top of the php files
- Use the files to populate your web pages. Iframe is the easiest one.
